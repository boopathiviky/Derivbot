# Derivbot: LSTM-Based Binary Options Trading Predictor

Derivbot is a project aimed at predicting binary options trading outcomes using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. This tool is designed for use within the app.derive.com platform, automating trading decisions based on the predictions generated by the LSTM model.

## Features

- LSTM network for binary options trading prediction.
- Integration with the app.derive.com platform.
- Selenium automation for executing trades based on predictions.
- Customizable parameters for training and trading strategies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/boopathiviky/Derivbot.git


2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt



## Usage

1. Configure your Deriv account credentials in `config.py`.
2. Train the LSTM model using historical trading data. You can use the provided dataset or replace it with your own.
3. Once the model is trained, run the bot:


## Configuration

In `config.py`, you can customize various settings:

- `MODEL_PATH`: Path to the saved LSTM model.
- `TRADING_INTERVAL`: Interval for trading (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour).
- `TRADE_AMOUNT`: Amount to invest per trade.
- `INDICATOR_THRESHOLD`: Threshold for trading decision based on model prediction confidence.
